Welcome to the Automated Testing Framework project! This framework is designed to help you automate the functional testing of web applications using Selenium and Java. It provides a structured, scalable, and easy-to-maintain environment, enabling efficient testing across various browsers and platforms.

Developed by Shivam Chaturvedi, this framework aims to streamline the testing process, reduce manual effort.

**Features**


Page Object Model (POM): Ensures organized and reusable test scripts, promoting a clear separation between page elements and test logic.
Data-Driven Testing: Supports running tests with multiple data sets from external files such as Excel or CSV.
Cross-Browser Compatibility: Execute tests across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.) to ensure your web application is consistent and functional across platforms.
Customizable Reporting: Generate detailed HTML and PDF reports for easy analysis and documentation of test results.
CI/CD Integration: Easily integrate the framework with CI/CD tools like Jenkins for continuous and automated testing.
